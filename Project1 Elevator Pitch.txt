***Below are our outlines of the project. -------------------------------------------------------------
	
- SuperBowl Summary 
	
- the following can be posed as questions

	- Exploratory Data Analysis on viewership vs attendance at venues, what was greater?

	- Ticket sales & 'eateries' vs. home viewership & consumption, correlation?
	***Please avoid Pie charts, Tom doesn't like it. LOL
	- location based attendance vs home viewership, correlation?

	- historical trend and whether current viewership stronger vs a 5 years to a decade ago

	- teams and their impact on ticket sales and attendance vs. home viewership



Focus
- dollar value and viewership
- teams have an impact on the viewership
- location may have an impact on the attendance
