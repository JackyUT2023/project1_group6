Project Proposal

Elevator Pitch - Intrigued by the viewership of the single most popular sport in North America, our team decided to analyse the viewership of the SuperBowl event alone, and compare and contrast to any impact due to the location, teams competing, and sports betting.


Possible data source:
	- Ticket sales in differnt sport centers - How much people are willing to spends on watching live sport games 
		--> API/CSV
	- Data from TV sport channels --> API/CSV 
		--->>Pie Chart
	- # of sport players data on current and previous years from official organizations
		--> Trend Analysis -->>Liner Regression and prediction

Any relationship between income and sports?
	- for example, people in higher income would prefer horse riding? golf? 
		--> Bar/Scatter Plot
		--> static summary

Any relationship between geographic/regional factors and sports?
	- for example, people in Toronto may like basketball and baseball more; while people in Montreal/Quebec region may like Hockey more?  
		--> Map plot
