NFL, Super Bowl & Sports Betting

Most of the research on paper with inaccess to the underlying datasets. Reached out to a few authors on sites such as Statista and the American Gaming Association with no response.
Sports Betting has developed into a huge market in North America, with state-wide legislation placed, approved, and accepted in 2017 for majority of the states in the US. In Canada, Sports Betting was legalized in 2021 so the underlying reporting data still needs a few years of maturation.
Sports betting in the early 2010s was an approx. $100 million legal market and was legalized in 2017. Since the census in 2022, Sports betting within the NFL has increased participants of approx. 70 million people with a sizable increase YoY. Furthermore, the market has increased total to approx. $200 billion plus with the NFL and Super Bowl holding the largest amounts of bets, and viewership of all time.
